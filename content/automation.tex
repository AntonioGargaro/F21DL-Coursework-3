\section{Automation Through Python}
\label{sec:auto}

Coursework 3 demanded a vast range of experiments on new data-sets. Thanks to our Python scripts from coursework 1 and 2, we were able to quickly convert CSVs into our standard format and run multiple experiments automatically. Below is a short list of what we achieved with our scripts.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convert both sets of data to ARFFs.
    \item Specifically, change the `Happy' set to have the emotion attribute at the start rather than the end. Change `Happy' and `NotHappy' to 1 and 0 respectively. Change all `Column' attributes to `Pixel' attributes.
    \item Automatic splitting of CSV files and convert them to ARFFs.
    \item Automatic experiments with various options of J48 algorithm, discussed in section \ref{sec:dt:j48}.
    \item Automatic experiments with various options of Random Forrest algorithm, discussed in section \ref{sec:dt:rf}.
    \item Automatic experiments with various options of Multilayer Perceptron, discussed in section \ref{sec:mp}. 
\end{itemize}
