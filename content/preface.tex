\section{Preface}

\subsection{Useful Information} 
Our project is available at the Google Drive link (\textbf{Appendix 1.1}) and Bitbucket link (\textbf{Appendix 1.2}). The README.md contains a full explanation of project structure and data files. We use Python with weka-wrapper3 to fully automate tasks 1-8, without the use of Weka GUI (apart from the visualiser and User Classifier tasks). All group members contributed equally. All results of our experiments are in the Google Drive link at `./CW3-2017/Results/' where files are labelled appropriately.
