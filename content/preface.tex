\section{Preface}

\subsection{Useful Information} 
Our project is available at the Google Drive link (Appendix 1.1) and Bitbucket link (Appendix 1.2). The README.md contains a full explanation of project structure and data files. We use Python with weka-wrapper3 to fully automate tasks 1-8, without the use of Weka GUI(apart from the visualiser). All group members contributed equally.

All results of our experiments are in the Google Drive link at `./CW3-2017/Results/' where files are labelled appropriately.
